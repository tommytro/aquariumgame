Game about an Aquarium that you can find new fish and other animals to put in. 


# Game Design

## Gameplay
Play as a cat/dog? fisherman on a small island. You will have an aquarium that you can build up as the game progresses. Most of the gameplay is catching cool fish and unlocking new locations. There will be npcs that will sell upgrades to fishing rod, boat, home, aquarium, and maybe other fun goodies to improve gameplay. 
Main gameplay loop cconsists of catching and storing fish in the aquarium, similar to animal crossing but with a bit more depth of fish catching. You can fish from an island or from the boat and can use the boat to navigate to other islands. There will be obstacles to reaching more exotic locations in both the water and on land, such as ponds inside an island that requires some puzzles to solve. 

Invite friends to fish with and chill. Not sure if implementing full multiplayer will be a good idea or not, but maybe allow travel to unlocked locations and main island. 

Maybe diving can be added later.

## Visuals
Low poly stylized graphics. Should be more straightforward to learn how to make and will improve performance/accessibility for low power hardware.
